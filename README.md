If for some unknown reason in Latex you used \bibitems instead of bibtex, this script allows you to sort the entries alphabetically. Please remember that the script was written in a hurry and is not bulletproof. It works well with the following structure:
<br>\bibitem{tag}
<br>ENTRY TEXT
<br>(ANY amount of blank lines)
<br>\bibitem{tag2}.

How to use: Simply dump all entries into an input .txt file.
